# CYB-599-Critique-2
This is a code repo of AntMe! game done by Niteesh Chandra Vejendla.  
http://www.antme.net/ Here, above is the link where AntMe! can be downloaded.

1) Here we can have ants summon from Ant-hill.
2) Here we can have ants attack the bug and run away to regain the lost health, In "Fight" method.
3) Here we can make ants to collect sugar and fruits in group and bring them back to Ant-hill.
4) The new feature that I added is "MakeMark", here ant sprays a scent marker at current location like in my case near sugar so that other ants near it can also locate the sugar.
